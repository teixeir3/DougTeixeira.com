  <h1 class="text-center">About Me</h1>
</div>


<p>I  graduated in 2011 with a B.S. in Business Administration with specializations in marketing and a minor in psychology. In school, I enjoyed my computer science classes such as Advanced Programming in Java, and have since taught myself web development with the help of AppAccademy.io</p>

<p>At age 22, I co-founded a health IT consulting company where I was able to dable in web development through website builders such as squarespace.com. When I quickly felt limited by site builders, I taught myself full-stack web development and fell in love.</p>

<p>Besides web development and technology, I have a passion for traveling and culture, experimenting in the kitchen to cook yummy food, and taking sunday drives on my motorcycle. I love learning and exploring new things, be it trying a new programming language or discovering the culture in a new city, exploration is in my blood!</p>
